Hi there! I'm a UT Austin student looking to develop skills in programming, and just overall getting a better grasp of computer science. I've always been drawn to computers, and I've always wanted to code when I heard about it in high school. I'm also a huge theatre nerd. I'm so excited to start this journey of programming and coding.
Bills.
